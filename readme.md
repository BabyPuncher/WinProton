These userChrome style sheets are meant to give the new Proton UI introduced in Firefox 89 a more native look in Windows by integrating your Windows accent color into the browser chrome.

These styles are not fully comprehensive, and may not look perfect with all possible accent colors in Windows.

Some notes about getting the best results:

* The dark version is meant to be used with a darker accent color along with Firefox's built in "Dark" theme enabled.
* The light version is meant to be used with a lighter accent color along with Firefox's built in "Light" theme enabled.
* The "System" theme is not recommended for use with either of these stylesheets.
* For dark mode, you may want to tweak the white ratio on lines that use color-mix() to get more desirable contrast with your color.
